## 3.0 Deploying an app to a Swarm
This portion of the tutorial will guide you through deploying the Flask application we made to Heroku using Docker.

**Important.**
To complete this section, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine as mentioned in the [Setup](./setup.md) section. You'll also need to have a Heroku account, which you can get [here](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you don't have one.

### What is Heroku?
Heroku is a simple cloud hosting platform. Their service makes it easy to publish your applications on the web without having to create and manage your own web server.  It relies on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure and works well with Docker!  There's even a limited free account which you can use for this tutorial.

Start by `cd`ing into the directory containing your application.  

### 3.1 Installing the Heroku Container Registery plugin

>**Note:** We're going to use the Heroku CLI to deploy this application.  Make sure you sign up for [a free Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) and install the CLI by [folowing these instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

Heroku created a handy plugin for working with Docker Containers. Set it up by running the following commands:

```
heroku plugins:install heroku-container-registry
heroku container:login
```

### 3.2 Creating & Deploying your Heroku App

Before we can deploy to Heroku we need to create a new Heroku application. We can easily create one from the command line by running the following command:

```
$ heroku create
Creating â¬¢ alpine-spring-40138... done
https://alpine-spring-40138.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/alpine-spring-40138.git
```

Check out the `APP NAME` printed out by the Heroku CLI.  Heroku programatically generates a random application name if you didn't specify one. You will need to reference the application name you see in the next step.

Now we can use the Heroku `container:push` command to build and publish our Docker image on the app we just created.

```
$ heroku container:push web --app alpine-spring-40138

### 3.3 View your Live Website!

Congrats! You just deployed your first Docker Image to the Internet.  To view it in your browser, just run the following (substituting in your Heroku application's name):

```
$ heroku open --app alpine-spring-40138
Opening app... https://alpine-spring-40138.herokuapp.com/
```
You should see the Flask app we made early, but now available on the web for you to share with your friends!

### 3.4 Next steps
Now that you've built some images and pushed them to the wbe, you can explore more of Docker by checking out [the documentation](https://docs.docker.com). And if you need any help, check out the [Docker Forums](forums.docker.com) or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/docker/).
